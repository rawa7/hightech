# Home Screen Redesign - Implementation Summary

## 🎉 What's New

### ✨ Complete Home Screen Redesign
The home screen now uses the comprehensive `home.php` API endpoint to display rich product sections with beautiful UI and full cart functionality.

### 📱 New Screens Created

#### 1. **All Brands Screen** (`lib/screens/all_brands_screen.dart`)
- Displays all brands in a grid layout
- Click on any brand to filter and view products from that brand
- Beautiful brand icons and images
- Products can be added to cart directly from this screen

#### 2. **All Types Screen** (`lib/screens/all_types_screen.dart`)
- Displays all product categories/types in a grid layout
- Click on any type to filter and view products of that type
- Color-coded category cards with icons
- Products can be added to cart directly from this screen

### 🏠 Enhanced Home Screen Sections

The home screen now includes the following sections with the new API:

1. **🔥 Hot Deals** - Discount items with special sale badges
2. **✨ New Arrivals** - Latest products added to the store
3. **⭐ Editor's Pick** - Curated featured products

  "discount_items": [...],
  "picked_items": [...],
